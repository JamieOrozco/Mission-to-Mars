# Mission-to-Mars

## Adjusted the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. Used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

#### Technical Issue. It wont load browser. Please assist. Even received a tutor lesson and didn't solve problem.
